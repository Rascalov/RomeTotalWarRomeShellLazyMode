# RomeTotalWarRomeShellLazyMode
Uses simulated keystrokes to make a macro of multiple commands needed to enjoy cheating. This program aims to simplify making and using romeshell codes.

Please note that even with time I spent figuring out how the make the romeshell work for all characters, there are some that just defy logic or have a different memmory address and can't be reached in romeshell with just their name. These are a few generals from the Eastern factions and some generals from the greek cities.  

Best way to use this is to have Rome total war in windowed borderless mode and use the application on top of it
